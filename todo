High Priority
=============
Add minargs parameter to symbol class or make args class?
    - The Symbol class needs to be capable of storing a type for
        each parameter in a list of parameters and the minimum number
        of required parameters, it needs to remember the names for
        each type in case it is specified as a keyword argument
        arguments: [(name, type)], minargs
Add types of builtins to initial scope
Check argument default values for substitute decorators

Support import from and aliases
Don't override return type with None, allow other type to override None
Check that arguments have acceptable types in visit_Call


Medium Priority
===============
Implement visit_Delete and actually remove items from scope
Support calling functions that are defined later (needed for mutual recursion)
Check each assignment in AssTuple

Low Priority
============
Error for "print" outside of main function
Cache results of imports for speed

High Priority
=============
Process self.x into object namespace
Support import from and aliases
Fix BinOp: allow multiplication of string with integer,
    addition of strings, lists, tuples
Support heirarchical module names in import
Fix Compare: in, not in
Check that __init__ takes at least one argument

Add types of builtins to initial scope
Support calling functions that are defined later (needed for mutual recursion)
Check each assignment in AssTuple

Low Priority
============
Implement visit_Delete and actually remove items from scope
Cache results of imports for speed

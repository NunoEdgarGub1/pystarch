Add types of builtins to initial scope
Support import from and aliases


Medium Priority
===============
Implement visit_Delete and actually remove items from scope
Support calling functions that are defined later (needed for mutual recursion)
Check each assignment in AssTuple

Low Priority
============
Error for "print" outside of main function
Cache results of imports for speed

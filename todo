    addition of strings, lists, tuples
Support heirarchical module names in import



Medium Priority
===============
Implement visit_Delete and actually remove items from scope
Support calling functions that are defined later (needed for mutual recursion)
Check each assignment in AssTuple

Low Priority

Error for "print" outside of main function
Cache results of imports for speed
